# Log All The Things
Provides default export `log`. Used as a function, `log(foo)`, it logs normal white output to the console,
pretty-printing any standard objects passed to it. Also provides `log.success()`, `log.info()`, and `log.error()`
functions, which simply output color (green, blue, red, respectively).
